Things to implement:


There should be a graveyard area. NPCs who die will have a grave set up for them.



7 summons.

5 main summon quests. 2 extra summon quests.

Some summons you have to fight. Others they progress story.

There's the moons echo's, and the mirrors of the bloodmoon. Opposing factions.

In general people aren't born, they manifest into this world. There is no memory of a childhood or such things

It is believed there were past lives, but it is pointless to imagine what they might've been.

Echo's death is glitched and his next life always manifests back into this world.


The game is just more or less here for exploration, platforming, fun characters and quests, and stuff.
no need to actually do the main quest. THat's just a device to move the game forward and give you something to do


the main plot focuses around summons. You are a summoner and you do tasks related to summoning certing beings

brewmaster Kay will make you all kinds of brews depending on what you bring. Usually tea in exchange for flowres
but will also make special consumables if you bring her special beans

You are not the only with a death manifestation glitch.

It rains a lot. It normally doesn't matter, but it can.

Some flowers are better off saved for quests than to be used as an equip.

Bouquets can be made.

There is a big toe hiding somewhere. It can't be killed. It won't kill you, but it will annoy you.

Nyx the fox will give you advice. But how will it be received?




Inventory drops can work with irandom. First determining how much of the slain NPCs items you get, and then the order in which they are dropped(so it's always a random amount)
there should also be a check to make sure specific NPCs drop all or specific items at least
